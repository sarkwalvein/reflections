How did vieweing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

It makes the process of finding differences fast and reliable
Fast, because it is automated
Reliable, because it finds the difference even if it is subtle
People normally don't read whole words, just look for the shape
if the shape of the word is similar you could miss the difference
diff does not miss the difference


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You don't have to keep backups and you avoid data loss
In case of a bug you can look back to previous version, restore a working one, look for differences, etc.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You have logical commit that group changes to code for similar functions.
This makes it easy to find and revert files related to a specific bug.
